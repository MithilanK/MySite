      The Perspective of an Asian Kid who goes to a highly competitive highschool when it comes to Affirmative Action: </br></br>
      I would like to preface this article with clarifying that, while I DO go to a competitive school, I am not a top student. I predict that I am in the top 8% of my class, which is good but there are still many students who perform better than me and this may influence my perspective. </br></br>
      I believe that affirmative action is truly equitable and necessary. </br></br>
      While many of my peers disagree with this claim, one unarguable point becomes of paramount importance: My highschool has more extracurriculars than some private schools. My highschool has more AP classes than most charter schools. The students in the upper percentile mostly have college counselors and tutors who have masters degrees. The top students in my grade are all Asian or White with some form of legacy at top schools. These top students certainly don’t have to worry about gun violence on their walk to school (If they even walk to school) . An extreme majority of students in my school do not have to worry about finances or debt that their family could be going through. Most people do not have this privilege. Affirmative Action sheds some light on the “not so fortunate” majority of people. Affirmative action gives a chance to the kid whose school doesn’t offer math past Algebra 2. Affirmative action gives a chance to the kids whose schools don’t have any extracurriculars, to the kids whose schools are only open three days a week. Affirmative action is an equalizer which attempts to make up for the mass economic inequality which exists in the college selection process.  </br></br>
      “Affirmative action is racist towards Asians” and “Not everything is about race”</br></br>
      I think of this matter as somewhat sensitive due to the toxic environment that a lot of Asian kids are currently in. This somewhat complex issue boils down to one fact: The goal of Affirmative Action is NOT to make the most Competitive Asian as successful as the Average Black Person. In my last paragraph, I explained the income-based differences of highschools, now I am focusing on the equally crucial racial inequality among primary school students in America. Understanding this issue requires acknowledging the layers of system racism which has affected black and hispanic people. A general rundown of this system of racism includes the white man forcing black people to come here via slavery, and later on segregation and targeting of black and hispanic communities. After facing this oppression, the Asian was introduced. After 20-30 years, Asians infiltrated top colleges and institutions. Asian’s success can be partly attributed to the immigrant “study hard” mentality. This mentality was stripped of African and Hispanic people due to the fact that many were FORCED to be in America (They were not eager motivated immigrants). Since Asians did well and worked extremely hard in America, and did not face the same racial baggage as black and hispanic people, the “Model Minority” myth was constructed. The “Model Minority” myth was a way to push down other marginalized groups by saying, “you guys could just work hard and do as well as the asians”. While the Model Minority Myth is constructed upon the Immigrant mentality, the White man stripped black people of the possibility of an immigrant mentality. The irony of the situation is that while the white man complains about how black people do not compare to the Model Minority, those same white people are the reason that black people are not the Model Minority. But how does this relate to Affirmative Action? Well this Model Minority Myth led to Asians being given more chances and facing less prejudice (keyword: less) than black and hispanic people, which made their rise to success easier, which made the Minority Myth stronger (hint: it's a cycle). Another forgotten detail is how Asian people have benefited from Affirmative Action for a while before they even had representation in schools. Since Asian people faced less system oppression, and did benefit from Affirmative Action to a degree, it is only fair that Asians are left out of the reparations offered by Affirmative Action. </br></br>
